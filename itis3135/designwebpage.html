                        <p>Overview</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Application and its Purpose<p>This is an application used to teach javascript and html 
                                to beginners. The intended users are people who want to have a quick guide to basic 
                                javascript functions and how they help with coding web pages or beginners who want to 
                                learn javascript. The website will have multiple pages. There will be a page with beginner 
                                concepts like variable declaration, loops, and conditionals. Then there will be a page on the
                                history of javascript and HTML and then a page on applying javascript functions in HTML with 
                                buttons and forms. </p></li>
                            <li>Intended Users<p>This website is meant for beginners</p></li>
                            <li>Overview of the Content<p>This website will have a variety of content. One page will have an overview of html and 
                                javascript. Another will have a html based page which goes over how html works, and then talks about commonly used
                                tags and page formatting. There will be 3 javascript pages. One goes over simple things in javascript like declaring
                                variables and basic programming fundamentals. The next one, will Go over decisino making and looping in javascript. The 
                                last page will be a page that  shows the user ways to connect html buttons with javascript functions.

                                    <li>There will be a button that shows example programs with javascript. So the user will click the buttons and it will show the code and the 
                                        code will run on the user's screen so they can see it. Ex: user presses a button and alert pops up. The website will show the code for 
                                        the alert. 
                                    </li>

                                <li>This will be a page for the users of the website.</li>

                                <li>There will be code that shows users how conditionals and loops work. Similar to the last page, the user will press 
                                    a button and then code will run. Also, there will be areas where users put in inputs and it shows how loops and 
                                    conditionals. 
                                </li>

                                <li>No user input</li>
                                <li>The code will show the difference between types of tags. For exmaple a user can click a button to see the 
                                    standard h1,h2,h3,h4.. tags. Also the differnce between OL and UL lists. 
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Javascript on HTML Pages
                            <ol>
                                <li>Show the user how to make javascript interact with an HTML page</li>
                                <li>This will be a page for the users of the website.</li>
                                <li>
                                    Content will show users how to user javascript functions that apply to HTML code. 
                                    There will information on functions such as onclick(). 
                                <li>No user input</li>
                                <li>
                                    A basic quiz on javascript code where it will ask a user to complete a line of javascript or HTML so the 
                                    code runs properly. 
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        
                            </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Every page will have buttons in some ways. For example on Home, it will switch what language the page is describing for 
                        history. The HTMl syntax page will use buttons to show users the difference between different tags. The basics of javascript and
                        loops page will have buttons to run code. There will also be forms. On the Javascript on HTML page, the user will type in information 
                        to see what they learned. On the Loops page, the user will type in numbers to see how loops and conditionals work. There will be pages image 
                        carousels on the home page to supplement the information. An example of this can be seen towards the bottom on <a href = "https://www.lilymoorefarm.com/">lilymoorefarm</a>. 
                        I would also use a jquery plugin to enlarge an image on a click in case a user wants to see code. This would be used on all of the coding pages. 
                        This can bee seen on <a href = "https://imgur.com/gallery/kR5HSZQ">imgur</a>.
