      <p>Overall this website was put together very well and was very neat. There were no loose ends throughout this website and </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Good Stuff</strong></li>
        <li>Filenames had no spaces or capital letters.</li>
        <li>Both checkers worked well and header include worked</li>
        <li>Followed crap principles well and had a consistent feel overall</li>
        <li>Website was easy to navigate and looked well overall. There were no small inconsistencies such as formatting issues or the link underline under the css button. </li>
        <li><strong>Stuff That Can Be Fixed</strong></li>
        <li>The website is using a serif font for some of the areas such as in the project folder and in the title bar. Using a sans-serif font will make the website a little cleaner. </li>
        <li>Your color scheme has good contrast however, I would consider changing it because the 2 blues kind of clash with each other and are a little loud. </li>
        <li>Activity 11 page does not link back to tthe normal website which can make it difficult to navigate. </li>
        <li>A link was broken. If you clicked UNCC Home Page in the top left from the brand/services.html it would bring you to a page that does not exist. </li>
      </ul>
