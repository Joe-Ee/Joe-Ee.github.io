      <p>Overall this website was put together very well and was very neat. There were no loose ends throughout this website and </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Good Stuff</strong></li>
        <li>Filenames had no spaces or capital letters.</li>
        <li>Both checkers worked well and header include worked</li>
        <li>Followed crap principles well and had a consistent feel overall</li>
        <li>Website was easy to navigate and looked well overall. There were no small inconsistencies such as formatting issues or the link underline under the css button. </li>
        <li><strong>Stuff That Can Be Fixed</strong></li>
        <li>The website is using a serif font for some of the areas such as in the project folder and in the title bar. Using a sans-serif font will make the website a little cleaner. </li>
        <li>Your color scheme has good contrast however, I would consider changing it because the 2 blues kind of clash with each other and are a little loud. </li>
        <li>Activity 11 page does not link back to tthe normal website which can make it difficult to navigate. </li>
        <li>A link was broken. If you clicked UNCC Home Page in the top left from the brand/services.html it would bring you to a page that does not exist. </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Peer Review 2</h3>
      <h4>Evan Schlee's ITIS 3135 Page</h4>

      <p>This webpage is put together very nicely and has some very nice features such as the buttons in the nav bar being formatted very well.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Good Stuff</strong></li>
        <li>All of the pages on this site have very good formatting overall with colors that contrast nicely and each website having its own unique color scheme. </li>
        <li>The semi translucent background on the midterm page looks very nice and overall the midterm page is put together very well with great attention to detail such as images that have shadows.  </li>
        <li>The final exam page looks very nice so far and has a good base to work off of. The scripts seem to be working as well.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Stuff That Can Be Fixed</strong></li>
        <li>One small issue is that the font on the main page is a serif font instead ofa  sans serif font. </li>
        <li>The HTML checking script is not properly linked to some pages on the github.io page which means it cannot properly check every page</li>
        <li>Some pages such as the arrays.html page have issues with the checker and should have small details looked over to make it 100%.</li>
        
      </ul>
