            <h2>Well Done Website</h2>
            <h3><a href ="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a></h3>
            <p>
                The shopify website is the homepage for customers to get on shopify. It has a menu on the top for members to login and then other information such as how new users can get strated.
                As you scroll through there are desciptions and pictures of shopify's services.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Contrast:</strong> All of the text contrasts nicely with their backgournds. Also, Each section of the page contrasts with the next well so the user knows
                    when they have reached a new section of the website. The links on the website are obvious and stand out so the user knows they are clickable. 
                    The page flows down nicely and works well overall. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Repetition:</strong> This website has a good repeating design that consists of sections going down the homepage. Each section has an piece of media 
                    and then a description to go along with it. Everything is laid out in blocks of even sized rectangles on top of each other. 
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Alignment:</strong> This website is aligned well. The main bar of content is in the middle and within that large middle block there are sections that 
                    are split up into halves. The text in each section is aligned well within that section and looks even. The images are also well aligned within their
                    sections and fit well. 

                </li>
                <li>
                   <strong>Proximity:</strong> This design has unity because of it,s aligned. All of the pictures that go with certain text are close with it so the user knows that the certain picture is meant 
                    to accompany that text. Also, the sections are split up clearly enough so the user can tell the difference between them. 

                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Bad Website</h2>
            <h3><a href ="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School of Art</a></h3>
            <p>
                This webiste the shool of art's address on the top with a navigation section on the left. In the center left, there is a  title bar and then a description of the school. As you scroll down
                there is a calendar, and then a way to sign up for newsletters. Anyone at Yale is allowed to edit this website which is very interesting for a school website. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Contrast:</strong>This website does not utilize contarst well. Some headers fade into the background when scrolling because their 
                    colors are similar to the background. Also, a lot of the backgrounds behind the text are faded which distracts the user when reading. Also,
                    there is some text that is bolded for no reason in captions.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Repetition:</strong> This website has no repetition throughout it. No elements ore colors are repeated and most elements on the website clash.
                    The text size on the page is not consistent and all of the blocks of text have different colored backgrounds. This gives the website a very 
                    messy look and makes everything seem out of place. 
                 </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Alignment:</strong> Nothing on this website is well aligned. All of the content on this website is pushed to the left.
                     There are also some blocks of text that are next to each other. On the right half of the page there is a lot of blank space with the SOA background 
                     showing. 
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Proximity:</strong> Everything on this website is very close to each other. It makes the website feel cluttered. Nothing is spaced out well and the webpage 
                    utilzes the space poorly. 
                </li>
