            <h2>Including Javascript Code in HTML</h2>
            <p>
                An important aspect of javascript is that it is interpreted in the browser. In order to include any javascript program into html you must have a pair of &ltscript&gt tags. These are important because it allows for the recognition of javascript code. 
                Within the tag you can either link to a file or just put the code between the open and closing tags. Javascript files 
            </p>
            <h3>Using the innerhtml function in javascript</h3>
            <p>
                An easy way to change an html element's text is using the inner html function in javascript. This requires giving an element an id in the 
                html file and then using that ID in the linked javascript to get and set the innerhtml of that element. the syntax looks like:
                document.getElementById("name").innerHTML. This is how you get the content of the element. Below are some examples of how it can be used.


            </p>
            <figure>
            <img width = 421 height = 172 src = "images/innerhtml.PNG" alt = "An example of innerHTML being used">
            <figcaption>An example of innerHTML being used on a certain element's ID. In this example when the website is loaded on the user's side the text in theh1 will say "Changed texted"</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Appending Elements to the DOM</h3>
        <p>This way is usually regarded as 'better' than innerHTML because it is faster and it doesn't allow for += to append to it. 
            In a complex javascript and HTML applicaiton appending elements to the DOM using append will be a bettersolution to changing the page. 
            An example of this is shown below. 
        </p>
        <figure>
        <img src = "images/append.PNG" width = 617 height = 386 alt = "Example of JS with the append function">
        <figcaption>This code will end with a page that says "This text can change" and then have 10 lines under it that count up. 
            The constant bruh represents the body of the text. The loop will loop 10 times in each loop it creates a constant p which is an paragraph element 
            and then the text in the p element is changed to 'The number ' and then whatever i is. After, p is appended to the the body of the html element.
