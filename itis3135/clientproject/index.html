          HTML was original made in 1993 by Tim Berners-Lee. This language was based on Standard Generalized Mark-up Language which was a way to mark up text into differnet forms.
          A large difference between the 2 languages was the use of the anchor tag and href. These helped make this languge popular. After its creation it went through many different changes and in the early 2000s HTML 
          4 was made the standard.
