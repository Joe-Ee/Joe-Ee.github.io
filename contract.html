            <p>I, Joseph M. Onghena agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my 2022, ITIS-3135-091, Web App Design and Development  with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.</p>

            <p>I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>

            <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>

            <p>I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I havei have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.</p>

            <p>Signed: Joseph M. Onghena , 01/09/2022 </p>
